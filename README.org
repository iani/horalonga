Support tools for performing pieces of modern repertory of the Viola, made with SuperCollider

* Installation Instructions

1. Download SuperCollider from here: http://supercollider.github.io/download.html
2. Open (start) the SuperCollider application.
3. From Menu "File" choose "Open user support directory".  This will open in a new window in the file navigation tool of the operating system that you are using (Finder or other).
4. Look for a folder named "Extensions" in the user support directory which you just opened.
5. If the folder "Extensions" does not exist in the user support directory, then create it.
6. Copy the entire "horalonga" folder inside the Extensions folder.
7. On SuperCollider, from Menu "Language" choose "Recompile Class Library".

You should then obtain a window with labeled buttons for playing the non-tempered pitches that occur in Hora Long«é.
